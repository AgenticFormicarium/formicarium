## Formicarium logo
From the name - Latin word formica, meaning ant, the logo is a cyber ant that represents both an AI agent and the meaning of an ant and ant colonies as natural self-organising systems.

## Colors 
We will use a warm color palette that represent the colors of ants, a cold, blue palette that represents robots and technology and an additional palette like a mix of colors.
