# Idea
This folder is dedicated to capturing and organizing ideas, brainstorming sessions, and other related files. It serves as a central repository for all conceptual work and creative thinking, ensuring that all innovative thoughts are documented and easily accessible for future reference.

## Core Concept
Our project envisions a futuristic coworking factory scenario where multiple machines and robots, owned by different entities, collaborate seamlessly despite lacking common ownership. The system leverages an AI agent as the central coordinator. The AI takes user requests and transforms them into optimized manufacturing plans. It then organizes a diverse fleet of robots, ensuring they work together efficiently to create personalized products on-demand. This collaboration is made possible by the decentralized, shared access to expensive robotic infrastructure, funded collectively through crowdsourcing, allowing anyone to tap into top-tier manufacturing resources. Blockchain ensures transparency, security, and immutability for transactions, making the entire process more reliable and trustful.

## Project Name
Keywords that we focused on: Agent, autonomy, robotics, AI, blockchain, self-organizing, natural organisations  
The name we chose is **Formicarium**, which is the scientific term for an ant nest or ant farm. It comes from the Latin word formica, meaning ant. It represents self-organizing systems.
